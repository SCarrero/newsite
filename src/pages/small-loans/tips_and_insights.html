          <p><strong>If you own a small multifamily property—now, more than ever—it&rsquo;s good to be you.</strong> For
            the better part of a decade, the market has delivered low vacancies and higher rents. </p>
          <p>Apartment values have risen over 143 percent since 2009. As employment and wages continue to rise, 2017 is
            expected to be yet another strong year.</p>
          <p>Bottom line: It&rsquo;s a great time to cash-in on market improvements by refinancing— especially if your
            loan was originated in more difficult economic times. Growth is good and rates are still near historic lows.
            But, without the right preparation, you could find yourself short-changed.</p>
          <p><strong>5 Tips to Put More Cash in Your Pocket</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Aim for Accuracy.</strong> Spotty records make underwriting tough. Have at least 3 years of
                accurate operating financial statements and rent rolls. Identify any capital improvements.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Show Your Property Some Love.</strong> A well-maintained property shows owner commitment.
                Serious deferred maintenance could require you to escrow part of your proceeds to cover repairs,
                reducing cash at closing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Strive for Stability.</strong> Volatile expenses, income, or occupancy makes it hard for your
                lender to project income when underwriting. Strive for consistent operations. Have a spike in expenses
                or a dip in occupancy? Explain it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Count Out B- or C-class Properties.</strong> While some lenders might shy away from
                cash-outs on properties with lower-than-market rents, Freddie Mac Multifamily does not as long as the
                property meets the underwriting criteria.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Take a Fresh Look.</strong> Already have a go-to source for financing? Options have changed.
                You owe it to your business to take a fresh look, especially if you have owned your property for at
                least three years and it has experienced rent growth, or you have made improvements to boost rent
                potential.</p>
            </li>

          <p>When it comes to financing a small multifamily property, rising rates have the potential to reduce your
            loan proceeds or even kill your deal altogether.</p>
          <p>Here&rsquo;s what you should look out for and ways to make your transaction a smooth one.</p>
          <p><strong>The Fair Weather Lender</strong></p>
          <p>With rates rising, many traditional lenders many traditional lenders are becoming more restrictive on
            multifamily real estate in order to chase more attractive investments. For property investors, this
            translates into higher costs, more restrictions and less flexibility.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, nearly a dozen <a href="/small-loans/">nationwide lenders <span class="hide">Learn More About
                Small Balance Loan program from reading 3 Things to Know Before Financing</span></a> now offer small
            multifamily loans financed by Freddie Mac Multifamily. Since the company&rsquo;s mission is to ensure
            liquidity, stability and affordability in the market, they are always in the market and they are eager to
            finance small multifamily buildings in particular because these properties are a major source of affordable
            rental housing. </p>
          <p><strong>Inspecting Your Interest Rate</strong></p>
          <p>When the Federal Reserve adjusts rates, most lenders follow suit accordingly. But, again, the Freddie Mac
            Multifamily loan program is different. They look at a variety of factors across the mortgage market when
            setting rates. That makes them more competitive and less subject to volatility.</p>
          <p><strong>Hold That Quote!</strong></p>
          <p>When rates fluctuate, the quote that a lender gives you at the beginning of the process isn&rsquo;t always
            what you end up with at closing. The only requirement is that you <a href="/small-loans/">complete an
              application</a>. It&rsquo;s a simple way to get peace of mind.</p>
          <p>There are ways, though, to lock in greater certainty and still keep it simple. For example, Freddie Mac
            Multifamily lenders provide a quote for the full mortgage coupon, not just the rate. Plus, at no additional
            cost, they will hold the coupon for 60 to 75 days— enough time to get you to closing. The only requirement
            is that you <a href="/small-loans/">complete an application <span class="hide">Learn More About Small

          <p>When you hear the words &ldquo;agency financing&rdquo; you&rsquo;re probably thinking tortoise more than
            hare.</p>
          <p>Joe Back, Vice President of FM Capital, a Florida-based commercial broker, has a different perspective.</p>
          <p>&ldquo;When I present the terms and explain how straightforward the process is, there is disbelief; but
            building by building, owners are converting to agency loans,&rdquo; says Back. He sources small loans for
            Arbor, the top lender in Freddie Mac Multifamily&rsquo;s <a href="/small-loans/"><span class="hide">Learn
                More About Small Balance Loan program from reading The Surprising Truth About Agency Lending article
              </span> Balance Loan</a> program.</p>
          <p>So, why are small multifamily property owners opting for agency financing?</p>
          <p><strong>Always Lending, Everywhere</strong></p>
          <p>Bank regulations and rising rates are reducing available credit from local sources that most investors of
            small apartments use. Freddie Mac Multifamily, however, has expanded available capital for <a
              href="/small-loans/">small apartment buildings</a> with a nationwide program that&rsquo;s funded over $5
            billion so far. The company&rsquo;s mission is to support liquidity, stability and affordability in all
            economic cycles.</p>
          <p><strong>More Competitive Terms</strong></p>
          <p>There&rsquo;s no need to settle for full recourse when you can get non-course at no extra cost— which is
            the case on all <a href="/small-loans/"><span class="hide">Learn More About Small Balance Loan program from
                reading The Surprising Truth About Agency Lending article </span>Freddie Mac Multifamily Small Balance
              Loans</a>. Plus, you can lock in a low rate and payment for a longer term (up to 10 years) and get
            flexible prepayment options.</p>
          <p><strong>Room to Grow</strong></p>
          <p>It can be surprisingly easy to max out your credit limit with a local lender, bringing your portfolio
            growth to a screeching halt. Freddie Mac Multifamily Small Balance Loans, however, give you much more room
            to grow because they are not subject to the same local limits.</p>
          <p>Plus, using a Freddie Mac Multifamily Small Balance Loan means you are building a track-record with a
            funding source that doesn&rsquo;t geographically limit your growth.</p>
          <p><strong>Buckle Up, It&rsquo;s Fast</strong></p>
          <p>How fast? That&rsquo;s really up to you, but it&rsquo;s not unheard of for Freddie Mac&rsquo;s small loans
            to close in 30 days or less. In order to handle a lot of volume, the company created a fast and simple
            process, and provides all the requirements up front.</p>
          <p>The Freddie Mac Multifamily Small Balance Loan program is available through a network of approved lenders
            who originate these small loans nationwide. To explore your small loan options, visit <a
