        <h3>Additional Market Commentary</h3>
        <div>The decline in the Index over the past year is a result of strong property price appreciation and higher mortgage rates, which offset the growth in net operating income (NOI or income). Over the past year, property prices grew by 4.4%, mortgage rates increased by 29 basis points (bps), while NOI also grew by 5.1%. Combining these changes in the Index, it suggests that investors are paying more per dollar of property income compared to one year ago. Like in the previous few quarters, the rise in mortgage rates over the year was the primary culprit of the annual Index decline. Over the past quarter, the Index increased due to slight NOI growth and falling mortgage rates, which countered the effect of property price appreciation. Multifamily permitting was relatively flat and near the long run average. Favorable demographics and a strong labor market continue to create healthy demand for multifamily housing nationally.</div>
